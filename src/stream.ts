// Pause-and-resume approval protocol — compatibility shim.
//
// PRIOR BEHAVIOR (removed): this file used to poll `GET {apiUrl}/v1-evaluate/:id`
// and stream `POST {apiUrl}/v1-evaluate/stream`. Neither endpoint has ever
// existed on the runtime API — `/v1-evaluate` only accepts POST and has no
// GET or `/stream` route at all (see atlasent-api's
// supabase/functions/v1-evaluate/{index,handler,_entry}.ts: the entry
// dispatcher only distinguishes a `/close-ops` suffix from everything else,
// and handler.ts has no `req.method === "GET"` branch anywhere). Both code
// paths in this file always failed against a real deployment.
//
// This file now delegates to @atlasent/enforce's waitForApprovalResolution(),
// the canonical implementation, which polls the REAL status endpoint —
// `GET /v1/approvals/:id` (atlasent-api's v1-approvals, single-item route
// added alongside this change) — and is also what the primary single-eval
// path (src/index.ts) uses directly.
//
// Kept as a thin wrapper, rather than deleted, so src/v21.ts's existing
// `waitForId` (batch/v2.1 preview) call site keeps compiling and pointing at
// a real endpoint without a wider rewrite of that undocumented surface. Note
// the field is still named `evaluationId` here for source compat — it is
// actually the approval_request_id (v1-evaluate's hold/escalate response
// field), same as everywhere else in this protocol.
//
// v2Streaming has no effect: there is no SSE endpoint to stream from. It is
// accepted (not rejected) so existing callers don't hard-fail, but the wait
// always polls.
